give the name as inverter_test and click ok and go to instance and then select library_name and then click on inverter and place it
instance -> Then select analogLib and then vpulse (v1=0,v2=1.8,period=20n,pulse width=10n,rise and fall time=1n) and place it
instance -> Then select analogLib and then vdc (DC voltage=1.8) and place it
instance -> Then select analogLib and then cap (capacitance=0.1pF) and place it and then add ground
then add wires and name the wire by right clicking on the wire (vin and vout)
